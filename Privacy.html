Last updated: Nov 2, 2025

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how I (“the Developer”, acting as an individual trader) collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Chrome extension Free Mahjong Games.

Your privacy is very important, and I do not sell or share your personal information with third parties.

2. Information Collected

The extension may collect minimal data required to provide its functionality, such as:

Anonymous usage data (e.g., feature clicks or number of active users) — used only to improve the extension.

Technical data such as browser version or error logs (if applicable).

The extension does not collect:

Personal identifying information (name, email, address, etc.)

Browsing history or website content

Sensitive or financial data

If the extension requests permissions (like access to tabs or active page), it is only used locally and never transmitted or stored externally.

3. Data Usage

Any collected data is used only to:

Improve extension functionality

Fix bugs and enhance performance

Understand general usage patterns (non-personal)

No data is shared with advertisers or analytics services unless explicitly stated.

4. Data Storage

All processing happens locally on your browser.
No personal data is transmitted to external servers.

If third-party APIs (e.g., YouTube, Twitch, or Steam) are used, those APIs follow their own privacy policies.

5. Third-Party Services

If the extension connects to external platforms (for example, fetching game data from public APIs), those platforms may collect additional data per their own privacy terms:

Twitch Privacy Policy

Steam Privacy Policy

6. Your Rights

You can uninstall or disable the extension at any time via your browser’s “Manage Extensions” page.
